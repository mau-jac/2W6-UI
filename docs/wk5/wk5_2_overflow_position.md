# Overflow

!>  For this section we will refer to the page **[CSS overflow Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp)** by W3Schools.

Using the reference above, look at the following [`overflow` properties](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_overflow.asp):

| Value   | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| visible | Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box. |
| hidden  | The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible. |
| scroll  | The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content. |
| auto    | Similar to `scroll`,  but it adds scrollbars only when necessary. |
| initial | Sets this property to its default value. [Read about *initial*](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_initial.asp) |
| inherit | Inherits this property from its parent element. [Read about *inherit*](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_inherit.asp) |
