# Welcome
This is the new companion site for the 420-2W6 course.

## Why a new one?
The previous GitBook interface had a few limitations, namely:
- HTML code code not be inbeded directly into the Markdown;
- Images could not be resized at will;
- Could not easily sync GitBook with local repository, creating discrepancies;
- GitBook's pdf export was a paid feature;
  
## How is this page made?
This webpage is writen in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), built with [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) and deployed to a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) project.

## Source Code
This page is open source, visit the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/mau-jac/2W6-UI).
