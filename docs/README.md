# Welcome

This is the companion site for the 420-2W6 course.

In this website you will find all the notes, labs and exercises for the course.



## Why a new website?
The previous GitBook interface had a few limitations, namely:
- HTML code could not be imbedded directly into the Markdown;

- Images could not be resized at will;

- Lack of HTML support created discrepancies with local repository;

- GitBook's pdf export was a paid feature;
