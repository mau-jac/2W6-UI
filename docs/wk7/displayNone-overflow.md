# Display None & Overflow



## Overflow

!>  For this section we will refer to the page **[CSS overflow Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp)** by W3Schools.

Using the reference above, look at the following [`overflow` properties](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_overflow.asp):

| Value   | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| visible | Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box. |
| hidden  | The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible. |
| scroll  | The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content. |
| auto    | Similar to `scroll`,  but it adds scrollbars only when necessary. |

The live demo from MDN web docs concisely illustrate the `overflow` property:



<iframe class="interactive" frameborder="0" height="400" src="https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/css/overflow.html" title="MDN Web Docs Interactive Example" width="100%"></iframe>

<br>

> For `overflow` to have an effect, the block-level container must have either a set `height` (or `max-height`) or `white-space` set to `nowrap`.
