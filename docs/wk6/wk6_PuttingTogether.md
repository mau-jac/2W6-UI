# Putting it Together

**Web Cookbook: simple guide for putting sites together**

## 1- Setting up page structure

Use semantic elements to communicate the meaning of major parts of the side.

Identify what parent-child relationships are necessary to create the desired layout.

Modify display properties to control flow behaviour and vertical spacing inside containers.

Control the width of elements but let the content drive the height.

Use filler or dummy content to create spacing. Temporary borders or background colors help visualize elements.

Decide how margins and paddings should change with font size and container width.



## 2- Spacing, images & rough colors

Introduce important influential content such as images, hero section or font types that "pop".

Apply a rough color scheme.

Adjust margins and paddings.



## 3-  Finalize content & color scheme

Add secondary and final content.

Adjust color scheme.
