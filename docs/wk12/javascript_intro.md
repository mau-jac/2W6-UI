## Origins

JavaScript was created during the browser wars in the mid 90's. In an ambitious maneuver to outperform Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE), the team behind Netscape Navigator commissioner Brendan Eich to create a powerfull, dynamic, language  that could run in the browser.  Brendan created JavaScript in 10 days.

Microsoft reverse engineered Netscape's JavaScript interpreter and dominated the market-share by including IE with Windows.

Netscape had to cease it's opperations. As a last move, they open sourced JavaScript. Brendan and others behind Netscape Navigator went on to cofound the Mozilla foundation.
